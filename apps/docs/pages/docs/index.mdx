# Installation

A react2app is a powerful tool for transforming React or Next.js applications into IOS, Android apps.\
Let's walk through everything you need to know to make your first app.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Start Development Server

```bash
npx react2app dev
```

You can test your app right away with 'react2app' app in AppStore, PlayStore.

This command will:

- Setup default values that you will need for generating app (react2app.config.js).
- Transform your React project into IOS, Android app.
- Show your app at http://localhost:3000

### Step 2: Build Your App

```bash
npx react2app build
```

You can make the file you will need to upload to AppStore, PlayStore.

This will:

- Create an IOS/Android production build of your app
- The result of your transformation
- Get your app ready for deployment

### Step 3: Deploy

Time to share your app with the world!

```bash
npx react2app deploy
```

This command takes care of:

- Upload your app(build that we made before) to AppStore, PlayStore
- We will help you fill out the form for AppStore, PlayStore

## Customizing Your Setup

Want to change some settings? Create a file called `react2app.config.js` in your project folder:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  port: 3000, // Change the port number
  output: "build", // Change build folder name
  publicPath: "/", // Change public URL path
  // Add any other settings you need
};
```
